# AI-Powered Security Monitoring System

## Overview

This project implements an intelligent security monitoring and response system using AI agents. It's designed to automatically detect, analyze, and respond to various security incidents in real-time.

## Features

- 🤖 AI-powered security agents
- 🔍 Real-time network monitoring
- 🚨 Automated incident response
- 📊 Network connection analysis
- 🔒 Port scanning capabilities
- 📝 Detailed incident reporting

## Architecture

The system is built around three main components:

### 1. Security Agents

- Network Monitor: Performs technical analysis and security assessments
- Security Admin: Evaluates findings and makes action recommendations
- Expandable agent system for future capabilities

### 2. Incident Handler

- Manages communication between agents
- Coordinates incident response
- Processes security events in real-time

### 3. Monitoring Tools

- Port scanning functionality
- Active connection monitoring
- Process tracking
- System resource analysis

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key
- Required Python packages (see requirements.txt)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the main application:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

## Extending the System

The system is designed to be modular and extensible. You can:

- Add new security agents
- Implement additional monitoring capabilities
- Create custom incident handlers
- Define new security protocols

## Note

This is a base implementation that can be expanded to include:

- Additional security agents
- More sophisticated monitoring tools
- Custom response protocols
- Integration with security tools
- Advanced reporting capabilities
- Machine learning components
- And more...

The current implementation demonstrates the core architecture and can be built upon for specific security monitoring needs.
